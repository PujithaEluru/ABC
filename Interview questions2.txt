40.order of Execution:
==================

System Validation Rules.
Executes all before triggers.
Custom Validation rules.
Executes duplicate rules.
Saves the record to the database, but doesn’t commit yet.
Executes all after triggers.
Executes assignment rules.
Executes auto-response rules.
Executes workflow rules.
If there are workflow field updates, updates the record again.
If the record was updated with workflow field updates, fires before and after triggers one more time. Custom validation rules, duplicate rules, and escalation rules are not run again.
Executes processes and flows launched via processes and flow trigger workflow actions.
Executes escalation rules.
Executes entitlement rules.
If the record contains a roll-up summary field or is part of a cross-object workflow, perform calculations and updates the roll-up summary field in the parent record. The parent record goes through the save procedure.
If the parent record is updated, and a grandparent record contains a roll-up summary field or is part of a cross-object workflow, performs calculations and updates the roll-up summary field in the grandparent record. Grandparent record goes through the save procedure.
Executes Criteria Based Sharing evaluation.
Commits all DML operations to the database.

41.Different kinds of report in salesforce?

Tabular Reports:
=================
Tabular Reports are the most simple type of Salesforce Report. They show your data in rows and are most effective when your goal is to export it. Tabular Reports shouldn’t be used when you want to manipulate data in any way like present totals, calculations, or groups of data.

Matrix Reports:
===============
Matrix Reports are a step more complicated than Tabular Reports where they can show data in rows and columns. They can be used to see different totals from your data and are effective when your goal is to display a huge amount of complex data.

Summary Reports:
================
Summary Reports in Salesforce are the most commonly used reports and are designed to show groups of data. With summary reports, you can group data by different accounts, and then do calculations to see totals, maximums, minimums, and averages. These reports allow you to easily see which accounts are bringing in the most revenue and which products or services they’re purchasing the most.

Joined Reports:

Joined Reports in Salesforce give you the ability to create two separate reports and compare their individual data. It’s not as commonly used, but can be effective when trying to learn distinct differences between accounts.

Master-Detail Relationship :
============================
It creates the parent(master) child(Detail) relationship between objects.
If we delete master records then detail (Child) records are deleted.
Rollup-summary field can be created in a master-detail relationship.
We can have maximum 2 master details on an object
Master is required field on the child object.

Look up Relationship :
=======================
Look up relationship creates relations between two objects.
If we delete any object then another object is not deleted.
Parent is not required in the child record.

50.what is self relationship?
A Self-Relationship is a lookup relationship to the same object. For example : we have a field on Account which is Parent Account that allows us to choose any account for being a parent account of an existing one.

Custom metadata is customizable, deployable, packageable, and upgradeable application metadata. First, you create a custom metadata type, which defines the form of the application metadata. Then you build reusable functionality that determines the behavior based on metadata of that type.

Public Group is kind of team or group of related users, this will help to share the data. Queues are typically used when you want to assign a record to a bunch of users. Using Queues you can assign a record to multiple users, so that any member of the queue can work on the record.
